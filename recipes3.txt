HOBBS FAMILY RECIPES
********************

These are recipes from my family of origin, many of which have been further
developed more recently.  They offer conclusive proof that real English cooking
is wonderful--it's just English restaurants that are bad.

Bon Appetit!

Beef Stew
*********

1 lb. stew beef (shin beef is best)
put in paper lunch bag with 2 tbsp flour, salt & pepper, and shake well.

brown it in the fat trimmings (slowly, browning all sides--the caramelizing of
the proteins in the beef is what makes the stew taste good)

1 clove garlic
about 2c water (to cover)
Make sure you get all the brown bits from the pan.
Cook 2 hr. at simmer until beef nearly tender
then toss in everything in the cupboard:
onions, turnip, carrot, and

a tiny bit of ketchup.
======================

Dumplings
*********

1c flour
2 tsp marg
2 tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
cut grease into flour
mix in milk (consistency is like pancake batter only firmer--a few lumps are OK)

spoon onto stew.  Cover, simmer stew until dumplings are done.

Yorkshire Pudding
*****************

3 eggs
3/4 cup flour
1c milk (homog)
pinch of salt
dash of nutmeg

Beat well in osterizer.
Refrigerate 3 hrs or so to wet flour.
Beat again.

take 2 muffin tins, heated, PAMmed, and with about 1 tsp of grease in the
bottom of each well (Dripping is best, olive oil is OK).

Pour 3/4 inch of mixture in the bottoms, bake on bottom shelf of 425 degree
oven, bake about 10 minutes until "set"--risen a bit at the edges, and not
liquid in the middle--then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to lift
them, until they're 3 inches high and deep brown on top.  Cook them less than
popovers; Yorkshires should have the consistency of a croissant or a brioche,
except eggier.


Fabulous Chocolate Cake (Bonks' favourite)
******************************************

1/2 c butter
2c white sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp vanilla
4 oz. chocolate
2 tsp baking powder
2 c flour
1 1/2 c milk
1c chopped walnuts

Icing
1/4 C butter
2c white sugar
2 sq. chocolate
1 egg
1 1/3 C icing sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp lemon juice
1C nuts

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 min.  10X14 pan


Ethel's Ice Cream  (Gourmet, Dec. 1974 You Asked For It).
*********************************************************

This recipe proves that it's possible for chocolate ice cream to be crunchy.
The hitherto-mythical point at which chocolate ends and ice cream begins.  We
gave quarts of this stuff for Christmas presents one year, and everybody loved us.

3/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup water
18 oz premium quality semisweet chocolate--Belgian if you can find it,
  otherwise Nestle's or Cadbury; *don't* use Baker's or especially Hershey's

8 eggs
4 1/2 cups heavy cream

In a heavy enamelled saurcepan, combine 3/4 cup sugar and 2/3 c. water, bring
to a boil over moderate heat, boil for 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to low, add 18
oz. semisweet chocolate, one ounce at a time, stirring and waiting until each
ounce is almost melted before adding the next.  Before the last ounce is
melted, remove the pan from the heat and let mixture cool, stirring often.  Add
8 egg yolks, lightly beaten.  Stir them in quickly so they don't cook into
lumps.  In a chilled bowl, beat 4 1/2 cups heavy cream until it holds soft
peaks.  Fold in the chocolate mixture.  Transfer the mixture to the ice cream
freezer and freeze.  Makes 3 quarts.


Mincemeat (Bonks' Recipe)
*************************

This stuff is half fresh fruit and half other stuff.  Pears make better
mincemeat than apples, because it's not as sharp.

Start with a 3 gallon enamelled pot  (want it half full of pears)
20-40 hard pears or apples, cut into 1/4" cubes and cooked lots.  (Maureen and
her friend Elizabeth Kelly didn't cook it one year, and it tasted fine but was
perhaps not mushy enough).  You can use Mott's applesauce if you like, but it's
not quite as good as pears.

3 lb. raisins (Muscats are best)
4 lb. currants
1 lb. suet (put in just before freezing)
Osterize 2 oranges, peel and all.
Put in the juice and peel of 2 lemons
1/4 lb citron peel
1/2 lb orange and lemon peel (mixed)--watch out for mixed peel that has
grapefruit peel in it

3 tbsp cinnamon                          о»
few tbsp salt (DO NOT OMIT!!!)            Д     to taste
1 1/2 lb. brown sugar.                   ог

Adjust:
thin with apple juice if necessary
add nutmeg
cloves
coriander !!!
 Taste and adjust: raw mince is sharper than cooked.


Mince Pies
**********
You can make mincemeat into small tarts or mince pies, or even into a large pie
with top and bottom crusts.  Mincemeat will burn if it's left exposed during
baking, so you have to use a top crust.  The best way to serve them is in the
form of "mince pies", which are actually slightly oversize tarts in new-world
parlance.

To make mince pies, make ordinary pie pastry (*not* sweet pastry) such as Craig
Claiborne's from the New York Times Cookbook, and roll it out as you would for a
pie.  Cut circles with a large-mouth mason jar lid.  Using a dinner knife, cut a
cross 1 inch by 1 inch in the middle of half of the circles (the tops).  Put a
heaping dessert-spoonful of mincemeat in the middle of each bottom, stick a top
on, and press the edges together to seal them.  The cross should open up a
little, which looks nicer and also lets the steam out.

Bake them on a cookie sheet.  Let them cool, and sift a little icing sugar
(confectioner's sugar) over top.  They're best lukewarm, and don't need ice
cream the way a big mince pie does.


Bread Sauce
***********

Bread sauce is what real English gentlefolk eat with fowl, duck, goose, or
turkey.  I far prefer it to cranberry sauce; my kids are divided on the issue,
but it has the makings of a religious issue.


3 cups milk  (homog)
2 med onions, chopped (original recipe was quartered)
1 tsp (24 pcs) whole cloves
pinch nutmeg (watch it--just a bit too much and the sauce turns bitter)

Boil milk, cloves, onion.  Reduce heat, simmer for 30 min (original recipe was
2 hr., but that overcooks the onions, and modern onions aren't as strong as in
the old days. Stronger onions make better bread sauce.)  Remove from heat.
Stir in nutmeg, add bread crumbs ( 1/3 loaf of stuffing bread or white Sunbeam;
staler is better, and don't use the kind with vinegar in it).

Put in salt and pepper, and a bit of butter if the taste is too thin.  If it's
a little too sour, a bit of (real) maple syrup fixes it up better than sugar
does.

Pumpkin Pie
***********

Squash makes the best pumkin pie--it's better on your dinner plate, and it's
better in pie too.  The best varieties for pie are buttercup (especially the
Sweet Mama variety), acorn, and butternut, in that order.  Yellow sweet potatoes
make great pumpkin pie too, but the orange ones that are like yams are worthless
in pie.  It's supposed to be gingery-tasting rather than cinnamon-tasting.

2c cooked squash, sweet potato, or pumpkin
4 eggs
1 tin evap milk (8-12 oz depending on how moist the squash is)
1 tbsp cornstarch
1c brown sugar packed
rind of one orange

nutmeg  (don't overdo the nutmeg even slightly or it gets bitter-tasting)
and ginger to taste, and an
eensy weensy bit of cinnamon.

Osterize and put into pie crust.



Plum Pudding (Ada Clark Danby (Polar's maternal grandmother))
*************************************************************

Christmas pudding is a wonderful contradiction--a strong
raisin-apple-gingerbread-almond-nutmeg taste with a delicate consistency and a
unique texture.  The recipe reads a bit like a fruitcake, but it's really more
like a soft, steamed gingerbread that is nearly overwhelmed with fruit.

Hopefully suet pudding will now make a comeback, since it's been shown that
animal fat is actually healthier than shortening.  Real suet is the fat
supporting the kidneys--butchers nowadays will want to sell you fat trimmings,
so order some real suet in advance from a real butcher, and demonstrate that
you know the difference between suet and ordinary fat.  Suet freezes well, and
if you render it down first to get rid of the tiny bits of meat, it keeps for
years in the freezer, as Crisco does.  Rendered suet tastes the same as raw in
this recipe, and you cook it to death anyway, so it doesn't matter much either
way.

4 eggs

2 scant cups beef suet

1c dark brown sugar
1/2 c dark table molasses
2c flour
2c fresh bread crumbs packed lightly
1c fruit juice (osterized canned apricots or peaches work well)
1 tsp almond extract
3/4 lb currants
3/4 lb muscat raisins
3/4 lb seedless raisins
1/4 lb mixed shredded peel
1/4 lb chopped almonds
juice and rind of one orange and one lemon
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp clove
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp ginger

Mix up in a big pot.  Steam 6 hours, then freeze until Xmas.  On Xmas, steam
for 45 minutes or so.  Remember to put a spacer (Mason jar rings work well)
under the bowl, and a lid of overhanging tin foil on top of the bowl to prevent
water condensed on the lid of the pot from getting  into the pudding and
turning it into soup.

Serve it with Hard Sauce:

Hard Sauce
**********

I haven't figured out the exact recipe for this, but it's really easy to
describe.  For four people, take 1 stick of salted butter and about 3 tbsp to
1/4 cup of brandy, kirsch, or (failing the above) one tablespoon of vanilla,
and stick it in the Cuisinart.  Grind it up with enough icing sugar
(confectioner's sugar) to make it stiff (like a hard buttercream icing) and not
greasy--probably 1 cup.

Spoon out globs of the stuff on a piece of tin foil, and stick it in the
freezer.  It hardens up quickly, so you can use it in a few minutes or keep it
for the leftover pudding.


Shortbread (Bonks')
*******************

The secret to melt-in-the-mouth shortbread is to sub sweet rice flour for
cornstarch.  Some people prefer half and half.
To make it lighter, cut the flour; heavier, cut the grease.

1/2 cup Imperial margarine
1/2 c butter
1c icing sugar or brown sugar
3 3/4 c all purpose flour (don't use unbleached)
1/4 c sweet rice flour

A try at Ettie Crescents:

Use Craig Claiborne's Viennese Crescents, sub almonds for pecans, put in 1C
extra flour, 2 eggs beaten, 1 tsp baking powder, orange peel, chocolate chips.

 ===========================  Other miscellaneous recipes ================

Play Dough
**********
2c flour
1c salt
4tsp cream of tartar
2c water
2 tbsp oil
food colouring

Mix dry ingredients. Add water, oil, and food colouring, and stir well to
eliminate flour lumps.  Cook over low heat 7-9 minutes, stirring constantly
(don't let it stick to the pan!)  When the dough pulls away from the side of
the pan, it's done.  Let cool, and knead before putting in plastic bags.
Refrigerate to store.  Lasts for months!

Nanaimo Bars
************

Nanaimo bars are a local specialty on Vancouver Island.  They have a
not very sweet chocolate/graham cracker/coconut crust, a very sweet, hard
custard-flavoured buttercream filling, and a layer of bitter chocolate over top.
The combination makes a very interesting confection.  Americans tend to like
stuff sweeter than Canadians do, so you may want to use bittersweet chocolate on
top the first time.
