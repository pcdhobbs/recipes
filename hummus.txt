Added cumin, rubbed sage, and chickpea juice.
Tried a sample with a bit of Chinese sesame oil, which was not a win.
Maybe try adding some black pepper?  There's
space for some other curry spice--probably not ginger or turmeric, but maybe
coriander.

2 cans chickpeas
2 tbsp chickpea juice
1/3 c tahini  (Sesame King brand)
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c lemon juice
1/4 c mild olive oil
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/3 c water
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp rubbed sage
1/2 tsp salt

Pulled out a clove of garlic (previous batch had 4, which was okay when just
mixed up, but too garlicky after a day or so).
