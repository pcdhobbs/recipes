Three cloves of cooked garlic (30s in the microwave) plus one clove fresh.
1/2 tsp mustard
1/2 c tahini
(Maybe a little too oily--back off on  the vegetable oil a bit)

Simon suggests that it needs a bit more front-of-the-mouth stuff.

Went with rounded 1/4 teaspoons, which is a win for everything except the
cayenne.

Put in 1/4 tsp of mustard powder, which counteracted the bitterness of the
tahini amazingly.  I think we can usefully go up the mustard + tahini axis for
the next batch.  So the current recipe is:

2 cans chickpeas (drained of all but the 2 tbsp)
2 tbsp chickpea juice
1/3 c tahini  (Sesame King brand)
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c lemon juice
1/4 c mild olive oil
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/3 c water
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp cumin, rounded
1/4 tsp rubbed sage, rounded
1/4 tsp powdered mustard
1/2 tsp salt

Added cumin, rubbed sage, and chickpea juice.
Tried a sample with a bit of Chinese sesame oil, which was not a win.
Maybe try adding some black pepper?  There's
space for some other curry spice--probably not ginger or turmeric, but maybe
coriander.

2 cans chickpeas
2 tbsp chickpea juice
1/3 c tahini  (Sesame King brand)
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c lemon juice
1/4 c mild olive oil
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/3 c water
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp rubbed sage
1/2 tsp salt

Changed from 1/3 c extra virgin to mostly mild oil
Pulled out a clove of garlic (previous batch had 4, which was okay when just
mixed up, but too garlicky after a day or so).

Added cayenne and salt


2 cans chickpeas
1/3 c tahini  (Sesame King brand)
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c lemon juice
1/4 c mild olive oil
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/3 c water
