Mincemeat (Bonks' Recipe)
*************************

This stuff is half fresh fruit and half other stuff.  Pears make better
mincemeat than apples, because it's not as sharp.

Start with a 3 gallon enamelled pot  (want it half full of pears)
20-40 hard pears or apples, cut into 1/4" cubes and cooked lots.  (Maureen and
Elizabeth Kelly didn't cook it one year, and it tasted fine but was perhaps not
mushy enough).
3 lb. raisins (Muscats are best)
4 lb. currants
1 lb. suet (put in just before freezing)
Osterize 2 oranges, peel and all.
Put in the juice and peel of 2 lemons
1/4 lb citron peel
1/2 lb orange and lemon peel (mixed)

3 tbsp cinnamon                          Í»
few tbsp salt (DO NOT OMIT!!!)            º     to taste
1 1/2 lb. brown sugar.                   Í¼

Adjust:
thin with apple juice if necessary
add nutmeg
cloves
coriander !!!
 Taste and adjust: raw mince is sharper than cooked.


Bread Sauce
***********

3 cups milk  (homog)
2 med onions, chopped (original recipe was quartered)
1 tsp (24 pcs) whole cloves
pinch nutmeg (watch it--just a bit too much and the sauce turns bitter)

Boil milk, cloves, onion.  Reduce heat, simmer for 30 min (original recipe was
2 hr., but that overcooks the onions, and modern onions aren't as strong as in
the old days.)  Remove from heat.    Stir in nutmeg, add bread crumbs ( 1/3
loaf).  Put in salt and pepper, and a bit of butter if the taste is too thin.

Pumpkin Pie
***********

2c cooked squash, sweet potato, or pumpkin
4 eggs
1 tin evap milk (8-12 oz depending on how moist the squash is)
1 tbsp cornstarch
1c brown sugar packed
rind of one orange
nutmeg
ginger
eensy weensy bit of cinnamon

Osterize and put into pie crust.

Plum Pudding (Ada Clark Danby (Polar's maternal grandmother))
*************************************************************

4 eggs
2 scant cups suet
1c dark brown sugar
1/2 c dark table molasses
2c flour
2c fresh bread crumbs packed lightly
1c fruit juice (osterized canned apricots or peaches work well)
1 tsp almond extract
3/4 lb currants
3/4 lb muscat raisins
3/4 lb seedless raisins
1/4 lb mixed shredded peel
1/4 lb chopped almonds
juice and rind of one orange and one lemon
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp clove
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp ginger

Mix up in a big pot.  Steam 6 hours, then freeze until Xmas.  On Xmas, steam
for 45 minutes or so.  Remember to put a spacer (Mason jar rings work well)
under the bowl, and a lid of overhanging tin foil on top of the bowl to prevent
water condensed on the lid of the pot from getting  into the pudding and
turning it into soup.

Shortbread (Bonks')
*******************

The secret to melt-in-the-mouth shortbread is to sub sweet rice flour for
cornstarch.
To make it lighter, cut  flour; heavier, cut grease.

1/2 cup Imperial margarine
1/2 c butter
1c icing sugar or brown sugar
3 3/4 c all purpose flour (don't use unbleached)
1/4 c sweet rice flour

A try at Ettie Crescents:

Use Craig Claiborne's Viennese Crescents, sub almonds for pecans, put in 1C
extra flour, 2 eggs beaten, 1 tsp baking powder, orange peel, chocolate chips.

Play Dough
**********
2c flour
1c salt
4tsp cream of tartar
2c water
2 tbsp oil
food colouring

Mix dry ingredients. Add water, oil, and food colouring, and stir well to
eliminate flour lumps.  Cook over low heat 7-9 minutes, stirring constantly
(don't let it stick to the pan!)  When the dough pulls away from the side of
the pan, it's done.  Let cool, and knead before putting in plastic bags.
Refrigerate to store.  Lasts for months!
